History
-------

This project was first released on PyPI on October 15, 2014 with version number `2014.10.15`. Almost five years later I decided to get back to working on it, but I disliked my previous choice for versioning scheme, so I simply released `v0.1.1` on August 5th, 2019. To avoid confusion, that original 2014 release was deleted from PyPI (but the equivalent code can be found on the git history of this repo at https://github.com/felipesanches/SolidPinball/commit/fc285a97756295a1fe028fd41fecbe9b9a9086be).
